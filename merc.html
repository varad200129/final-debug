  <br>The closest planet to the sun, <br>Mercury is only a bit larger than Earth's moon. <br>Its day side is scorched by the sun and <br>can reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 Celsius),<br> but on the night side, temperatures drop <br>to hundreds of degrees below freezing.<br> Mercury has virtually no atmosphere to absorb meteor impacts, <br>so its surface is pockmarked with craters, <br>just like the moon. <br>Over its four-year mission, <br>NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft has revealed views of the planet <br>that have challenged astronomers' expectations.
