  <br>Once the ninth planet from the sun,<br> Pluto is unlike other planets in many respects.<br> It is smaller than Earth's moon.<br> Its orbit carries it inside the orbit <br>of Neptune and then way out <br>beyond that orbit. From 1979 until early 1999,<br> Pluto had actually been the eighth planet<br> from the sun. Then, on Feb. 11, 1999,<br> it crossed Neptune's path and once again<br> became the solar system's most distant<br> planet — until it was demoted to <br>dwarf planet status.<br> Pluto will stay beyond Neptune for 228 years.<br> Pluto’s orbit is tilted to the main plane <br>of the solar system — where the other <br>planets orbit — by 17.1 degrees. <br>It’s a cold, rocky world with only a very<br> ephemeral atmosphere. NASA's New Horizons mission <br>performed history's first flyby of the Pluto <br>system on July 14, 2015.
