<br><b>History of The Sun</b>

<br>The Sun is by far the largest <br>object in the solar system. <br>It contains more than <br>99.8% of the total mass of the<br> Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest).

<br>It is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. <br>That's true in the sense that there are many<br> others similar to it. But there are many<br> more smaller stars than larger<br> ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. <br>The median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less <br>than half the mass of the Sun.
