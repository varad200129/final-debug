  <br>The seventh planet from the sun,<br> Uranus is an oddball. <br>It’s the only giant planet whose equator <br>is nearly at right angles to its orbit <br>— it basically orbits on its side.<br> Astronomers think the planet collided with some<br> other planet-size object long ago,<br> causing the tilt. The tilt causes extreme <br>seasons that last 20-plus years, <br>and the sun beats down on one pole <br>or the other for 84 Earth-years. <br>Uranus is about the same size as Neptune.<br> Methane in the atmosphere gives Uranus its <br>blue-green tint. It has numerous moons <br>and faint rings.
