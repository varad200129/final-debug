  <br> The fourth planet from the sun, <br>is a cold, dusty place. <br>The dust, an iron oxide,<br> gives the planet its reddish cast. <br>Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, <br>has mountains and valleys,<br> and storm systems ranging from localized <br>tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing<br> dust storms. It snows on Mars.<br> And Mars harbors water ice. <br>Scientists think it was once wet and warm, <br>though today itâ€™s cold and desert-like.<br>
