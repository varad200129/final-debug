  <br>The sixth planet from the sun<br> is known most for its rings.<br> When Galileo Galilei <br>first studied Saturn in the early 1600s,<br> he thought it was an object with three parts.<br> Not knowing he was seeing a planet with rings,<br> the stumped astronomer entered a<br> small drawing — a symbol with one <br>large circle and two smaller ones — in his <br>notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing <br>his discovery. More than 40 years later,<br> Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings.<br> The rings are made of ice and rock. <br>Scientists are not yet sure how they formed. <br>The gaseous planet is mostly hydrogen and helium.<br> It has numerous moons.
