  <br> The second planet from the sun, <br>Venus is terribly hot, even hotter than Mercury.<br> The atmosphere is toxic.<br> The pressure at the surface would crush and kill you.<br> Scientists describe Venus’<br> situation as a runaway greenhouse effect. <br>Its size and structure<br> are similar to Earth,<br> Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway "greenhouse effect.<br>" Oddly, Venus spins slowly in the <br>opposite direction of most planets.

<br>The Greeks believed Venus was two different <br>objects — one in the morning sky and <br>another in the evening. <br>Because it is often brighter<br> than any other object in the <br>sky — except for the sun <br>and moon — Venus has generated<br> many UFO reports.
